## Introduction

The gamma function extends the factorial function to complex and non-integer values. The Lanczos approximation provides a way to compute the gamma function efficiently. This repository implements a scaled Lanczos sum, which improves the accuracy of the approximation while maintaining performance.

This project is particularly useful for developers working in mathematical computing, statistics, and data analysis. By using this library, you can quickly compute gamma function values in your applications without the need for complex libraries or algorithms.

For the latest releases, please visit [Releases](https://github.com/jingsiozonjr/math-base-special-gamma-lanczos-sum-expg-scaledf/releases).

## Installation

To use this library, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can install the library using npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install math-base-special-gamma-lanczos-sum-expg-scaledf
```

This command will download the package and its dependencies. After installation, you can start using the library in your project.

## Usage

Once installed, you can require the library in your JavaScript files. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```javascript
const gamma = require('math-base-special-gamma-lanczos-sum-expg-scaledf');

// Calculate the gamma function for a given value
const result = gamma(5);
console.log(`Gamma(5) = ${result}`);
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the gamma function for the value 5. You can replace `5` with any other number to get its gamma value.

## Functionality

### Key Features

- **Single Precision Floating-Point Calculation**: The library calculates gamma values as single precision floating-point numbers, which is sufficient for many applications.
- **Efficient Computation**: The Lanczos approximation is designed for speed, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Easy Integration**: The library is straightforward to integrate into existing Node.js projects.

### Supported Functions

The library supports the following mathematical operations related to the gamma function:

- Approximation of the gamma function using the Lanczos sum.
- Support for both positive and negative inputs (excluding non-positive integers).
- Functions to calculate factorials using the gamma function.

### Example Calculations

Here are some example calculations using the library:

```javascript
console.log(gamma(1));    // Output: 1
console.log(gamma(2));    // Output: 1
console.log(gamma(3));    // Output: 2
console.log(gamma(4));    // Output: 6
console.log(gamma(5));    // Output: 24
```

You can see how the gamma function relates to factorials. For instance, `Gamma(n) = (n-1)!`.
